Title: Tool for defining gene orthology across species 
Version: 1.0
Authors@R: "'Gregory Gedman <ggedman@rockefeller.edu> [aut, cre]'"
Description: This package will find  all one-to-one orthologs (or a given for a given gene) 
      between two given species. The user defines a startin species and the species they wish 
      to know orthologous genes, and using biomaRt, will be returned a data frame of all 
      one-to-one orthologs. The user can also specify a specific gene instead of searching all.
